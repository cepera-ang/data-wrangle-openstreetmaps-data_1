# data-wrangle-openstreetmaps-data_final
## This is an OpenStreetMaps data cleaning project. 

In this project I use Python to perform cleaning and tidying of small OSM dataset (within city of Tymen boundaries).
Here I check some statistic about dataset and try to find something "strange". 
Also included report about completed work.
